# React + Vite + Ant project

It is an project for assesment on react internship.

It uses ant ui for most of the elements like table,button,form,etc.

Tailwind is used as an framework for writing css.

# Some unwanted features
 it looks like when i try to use w-screen to maximize width , ui doesn't look good so i have decided to just let min-h-screen be there in ./App.jsx
